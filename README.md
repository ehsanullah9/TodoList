# Simple Redux Todo App

This is a small Todo application built with plain JavaScript and Redux.  
I created it to practice how Redux works in a simple project.

## Features
- Add new todos  
- Mark todos as completed or uncompleted  
- Delete todos  
- Uses Redux for state management

## What I Learned
- How Redux actions, reducers, and store work together  
- How to dispatch actions and update the UI based on state changes  
- How to connect Redux logic with plain JavaScript and DOM elements

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ehsanullah9/TodoList.git
